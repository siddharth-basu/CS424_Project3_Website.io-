            <h4><strong>Weekly Summary: Feb 24, 2018</strong></h4>
            <p>Guillermo Rojas Hernandez progress: This week I focused on customizing the base template for the main Learning to Fly web page,
              and creating the base Shiny script and first visualizations for the Shiny application for Project 2.
            </p>
            <p>Yang Hao progress:  This week I focused on working with the data set using R.  An overview of my work is in
              <a href="pages/yang_hao_update_02-23-18.html">this webpage</a></p>
            <p>Natasha Rice progress:  This week I focused on downloading the data, cleaning up the data set, setting up the project on
              GitHub, and doing some of the initial R work on the dataset.</p>
            <p>Siddharth Basu progress:  This week I focused on learning more about the Shiny dashboard, coming up with ideas for the
              dashboard visualization, and doing some R work on the dataset.</p>
            <h4><strong>Weekly Summary: March 2, 2018</strong></h4>
            <p>Guillermo Rojas Hernandez progress: This week I set up the first draft of our application on the classroom Shiny server,
              and I also tested the application on the large class display.  In addition, I created the initial table that displayed the top
              15 arrivals and departures from Midway.  I also created drafts of the Shiny Dashboard that fulfill the requirements from sections
              C to A, and updated the website describing our progress.
            </p>

              </ul>
            <p>Natasha Rice progress: This week I created the required bar charts for the section C requirements.  I also selected a color
            palatte for consistency among the charts.</p>
            <p>Siddharth Basu progress:  This week I focused on helping create drafts of the Shiny dashboard and on sketching different ways to graph the data.</p>

            <p>The data utilized was chosen by the professor of the course, Dr. Andy Johnson.</p>
            <p>For the application, we created bar charts and pie charts using the ggplot library once the data was processed into R Studio. </p>
              <p>Manipulation of Data:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The data was cleaned and reduced by python script given by Professor Johnson. This script allowed us to turn CSV files to TSV files, with various lookup codes added. </li>

                  <li>For the Intereseting Days section, we were given more freedom, so we choose date datas in which we were familiar with: Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day. These are occasions that would increase definetly require someone to take a flight. </li>
                  <p></p>
                  <img src="img/interestingDays.png">
                  <p></p>
                   <li>For the graduate section, an additional data set was taken from the Bureau of Transporation Statistics, Datasets, in which the data is presented the same way as Professor Johnson, but further more variables like pasanger, distance, class, etc. It let us even specify the geographic location and click on each individual catagory variable to create a custom table for our requirements. This gave us a wide range of possible implementations of this data and how we can merge them into our project. </li>

                  <img src="img/GraduatData.png">
                  <p></p>
                  <li>For the Top 50 Aiports section, we pooled the airport data from both O'hare and Midway and then pulling Top 50 airports from the pooled data. This way we are visualizing the data at state level and compare it national level with other airports like LAX, ATL, HOU, etc. </li>

              <li>We have a side to side comparison with ORD and Midway which gives the user more options</li>
              <li>Now we can see arrivals and departures for both Illinois airports with clarity (Hourly).</li>

              <li>If we want to see a month to month comparison, there is a tab on top, which allows us to switch to month to month comparison in a heat map format to visualize.  </li>

            <h4>Thought#1</h4>
        <li>When looking at the US heatmaps comparing arrivals and departures, the data is consistent on both sides and almost completely similar. We were very confused in this data, but then came to the conclusion that these are regular flyers who are also doing a return trip back to their state. We also took into consideration that people that buy airline tickets, typically also buy a return ticket. It is on very rare occasions, where someone will just buy a one way ticket. </li>

            <h4>Thought#2</h4>
        <li>Another interesting data set we discovered was when we are doing a comparison of airline flights in a given month comparing with ORD and Midway. Looking at the airline: Atlantic Southwest Airlines only have flights at Midway half the year. We are baffled as a group where it is very strange that an airline is only active certain periods of the year. </li>

        <li>Further diving into the ASA's revenue in 2017 peaked at 93 million, compared to United Airline which is a giant, their revenue neted around 37 billion. So we came to the conclusion that it is a much smaller airline company, with much less comercial planes than their competitors. However what threw us off further was seeing that ASA has a high volume of flights in O'hare. Also, Airlines like American or United dont even have flights in Midway. This means that ASA is not alone to blame for inconsistent flights in a year at Midway, but also because Midway is a much smaller airport, with less runways, and a combination of ASA's small stature and Midway's size are the main reason for this graph.  </li>

        <p></p>
        <li>The image above is a representation of weather delays in the year 2017 from both Airports: O'hare and Midway. So we can visualize Illinois Airport system at a national scale. What baffled us here was seeing high weather delays in June, July, and August since Illinois has good weather in those month zones and we dont experience any severe rainy seasons as a state. So we looked at weather patterns around the country and came to the conclusion that this could relate hurricans in southeast of the country. The hurrican season in 2017 started in June 1st which supports this date set. </li>
